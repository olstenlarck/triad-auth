 *
 * The quiet timer is a Lifecycle job, never `ctx.storage.setAlarm()`. A Durable Object
 * has one alarm, and the Agents SDK Lifecycle owns it: after every queue change it arms
 * the alarm for the earliest job, and that queue also holds PiHarness's per-session
 * wake-up jobs. Setting the alarm directly would move Pi's wake-up, and Lifecycle's next
 * re-arm would silently move ours. Job ids are scoped to their owning capability, so ours
 * cannot replace Pi's. Pushing again under the same id replaces our pending job, and that
 * is the reset.
